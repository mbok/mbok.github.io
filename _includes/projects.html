    <h3>Elasticsearch plugin for linear regression</h3>
    <p>I'm the creator of a machine learning plugin for Elasticsearch providing aggregations to compute multiple linear regression on search results in real-time for predictive analytics.
       The implementation is open source and is based on an elaborated parallel, single-pass OLS estimation algorithm for multiple linear regression
       well-fitting for large-scale, distributed data sets.

    <h3>logsniffer</h3>
    <p>Inspired by tools like <code>tail</code>,
       <code>grep</code> and <code>less</code> I've created logsniffer with the vision to provide
       the same experience by a smart web tool when working with log files.
       logsniffer supports viewing all logs instantly in front of a browser, tailing logs in real-time, scrolling and searching through very large files â€“ forward and backward.
